# smart-Farming
project was designed to help farmers improve efficiency, save resources, and remotely manage their fields. Here’s how it works:
1️⃣ Automated Irrigation System: We developed an irrigation system that waters plants automatically based on soil moisture levels, using servo motors. This helps conserve water and ensures optimal hydration for crops.
2️⃣ AI-Powered Disease Detection: Our setup includes a real-time crop disease prediction feature using AI, with a live camera feed that identifies early signs of diseases. Early detection means healthier crops and higher yields!
3️⃣ Environmental Monitoring: With IoT sensors tracking temperature and humidity, farmers can monitor environmental conditions anytime, anywhere. We integrated this with Arduino IoT Cloud and Google Home for seamless access and alerts.
4️⃣ Remote Video Monitoring: Using an ESP32-CAM, we enabled live video streaming, allowing farmers to remotely observe their fields and stay informed.
